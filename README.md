# Schrödinger Equation

In the first chapter, we derive the time dependent Schrödinger Equation from the Einstein and De broglie equations of wave-particle duality. Then,
in the second chapter we develop the requirements that would be necessary, like partial differential equations and a little bit of Functional Analysis.
The third and the fourth chapters are dedicated to solve the Time Dependent and the Time Independent Schrödinger Equation, where we develop the difference
between a week solution and strong solution in the time dependent case. Also, we aboard the Quantum Tunneling effect in the fourth chapter.
Finally, to add sauce to the taco, we develop the operator theory of the Schrödinger Operators.
